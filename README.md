# Marensics
Marensics is forensics project under development. Basically it represents small bash automation script for forensics.
It stores everything in one directory, to be specific in one txt file. Not just that, it zips all log files and puts them
in same directory so you can prepare everything and check it later.

Made for Linux (Tested on Debian and Arch)

Keep in mind that this is a demo version and it is still buggy and not finished.

Usage: sudo bash marensics.sh

For any bugs, additional features you can contact me via my email.
For any type of collaboration I will give you my phone number through my email.

Free to use and free to modify.

I am not responsible for any kind of misuse of this script.
